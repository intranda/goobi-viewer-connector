# Goobi viewer - Connector
> Connector application as part of the highly flexible digital library framework - made by the Goobi developer team


## Connector for the digital library framework
The Goobi viewer connector provides several connectivity methods to the indexed data content of the Goobi viewer. Currently the connector supports two ways to let other machines communicate with the Goobi viewer:

### OAI-PMH
The embedded OAI-PMH connector provides a standard OAI interface for harvesters. Dependent of the configuration it offers the following formats for receiving the content:

- METS/MODS
- Dublin Core
- MARC XML
- LIDO
- Epicur
- ESE

### SRU
The SRU connector offers the possibility to request specific information from the data store of the Goobi viewer. This is used for example by the reference manager program [Citavi](https://www.citavi.com/en/) and others to embed the Goobi viewer data store into the databases that these programs search through.
